# SKYLON 

Skylon is a `web browser` written from scratch in `python`.

## WHY?
Goal is to build this into something like electron for python,
but instead of javascript you can run python.

## HOW?
- Read HTML, CSS, Python scripts.
- Tokenize HTML CSS
- Create DOM and CSSOM
- Run python scripts.
- Create render tree
- Paint

## PLANS
Currently creating tokenizers for both HTML and CSS.
Once done with those, will move on to tree construction stage.
Primary goal is to create a working demo first, so will skip
python scripts stage for right now will come back to it later.
Render tree construction.
Layout calculate.
Paint (Only basic tags and style rules supported at first)

NOTE: This is a school project.
